                I am a 3rd-year Computer Science PhD student at Vanderbilt 
                University in Dr. Taylor Johnson's Verification and Validation 
                for Intelligent and Trustworthy Autonomy Laboratory (VeriVITAL). 
                I am interested in research related to machine learning, reinforcement 
                learning, interactive technologies, cybersecurity, and generative 
                models and how they relate to trust in an area known as Trustworthy 
                AI. I am honored to be supported by a National Defense Science and 
                Engineering Graduate Fellowship.
